    "For `phc_kind`, I had determined that after around January 14th or so, I couldn't find any crash reports using \"`phc_kind` exists\" filter, but there were some crash reports that had a `PHCKind` annotation. It turned out to be a timing problem. At the moment when an index was created, if it was being created when saving a crash report that had a `phc_kind` field in the document, then the mapping would have a `phc_kind` field and then documents saved for that week would have a `phc_kind` field. Since `phc_kind` is rare, this never happened, so then the field would get dropped from all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AdapterDriverVersion` annotation is much more common, so if a document was getting saved that had a `adapter_driver_version` field and kicked off creation of a new index, then that index would have the field and crash reports would have the data saved. Otherwise, they wouldn't. That's why we see the wild flip-flopping between the weeks up to around 5/3/2021. For that week, we see most don't have the field but one does.\n",

    "The `adapter_driver_version` field had the same problems the `phc_kind` field had which started in January 2021 and the fix was pushed to production on April 28th, 2021.\n",

    "When searching with the `adapter_driver_version` field, we should ignore crash reports before May 3rd, 2021."
